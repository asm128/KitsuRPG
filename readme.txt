The upcoming features are:

- The ability for the equipment to have its own inventory, so you will be able to carry a weapon that contains pockets on it and use items from there or store items there.
- The ability to wear accessories similar to other equipment and to use a building for shelter. Both also researchable similar to everything else.
- The ability to sell things from your inventory and to construct new buildings.
- The ability to construct new buildings, weapons, armors, etc.
- The ability to research stage items such as payhones, semaphores, etc. recognized during combat.

After I'm done adding all that I'm going to start adding the tiled scenario and enable using more than one character in a fight.
